# UPLB DMIS: A Management Information System for UPLB Student Housing Facilities
Authors: Megan D. Echano and Fermin Roberto G. Lapitan

The University of the Philippines Los Ba√±os is one of the state universities in the Philippines that offers its own student housing facilities. However, the management system of each dormitory still relies on the traditional way of handling dormers' data with the use of a physical information sheet. The need for a dormitory management information system will significantly alleviate the current process of managing UPLB dormers' information by digitizing resident information and contributing to future-proofing dormitory management in UPLB. The UPLB Dormitory Management Information System is a web application specifically developed to digitize the traditional basic information of UP dormers and alleviate some of the management tasks of UPLB dorm staff. This study presents the development, testing, and evaluation of UPLB DMIS as a technical solution to the growing demands of dorm management. The system was evaluated using the System Usability Scale (SUS). It garnered a mean score of 84.67 which indicates that the web application has an 'A' grading and 'excellent' adjective rating.
